# Today i learned how to automate every task with Python and pyautogui library. It was so challenging that opens my mind to see and understand a universe of possibilities 
# I started to practice with my personal tasks. Creating a program that opens my Chrome with my favorite youtube channel; a program that send an email for me and so on.
# As i said, it was so challenging but funny too. Cause now i'm so exicited to study more and absord more knowledge
