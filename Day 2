# Yesterday (29/5/2021 or 5/29/2021) i made my first game, found it at "Python_Exercises" repository. It was amazing, i never thought that i'll be creating a game before.
# I know that's a commom game, and could be a bit easy to do. it's my very first step yet.
# Today, i'll try to study more about programmimg logic and stuffs.
